# Welcome!
This project is built using Python and the LangChain framework. Users can input the URL of the desired website and ask questions to the AI.

The project leverages LangChain's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system to utilize external data sources. Through the processes of loading, transforming, and embedding, the data is stored in a vector store. Refined answers are then retrieved using the LangChain system.

In this project, the main language model employed is OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo. The frontend chatbot interface is implemented using Streamlit, a pure Python UI library.

Follow the instructions in the "Installation" section below to create your own chatbot!
